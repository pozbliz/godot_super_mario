# 20 Games Challenge (https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/) - Game 6: Super Mario

### Goals:
- Create a 2D character controller. Mario should be able to walk, run, and jump.
- Create a single level. You can make world 1-1, or design your own level. The level should be made up of textured tiles. There will also be some special elements:
- Add “question mark” boxes. These will contain coins or power ups.
- Add warp pipes. Mario should be able to enter these by pressing the “down” button. He will exit a pipe somewhere else on the map.
- At the end of the level should be a castle and a flagpole. Touching the flagpole will end the level.
- Add enemies to the level. Goombas will walk in a straight line and turn around when they hit something. Jumping on a Goomba will squash it. Koopas will retreat into their shell when stomped on. The shell will move when hit again.
- Add power ups. A mushroom will cause Mario to increase in size. Feel free to add stars or fire flowers as well.
- Make your own sprites, sound effects, and music. Pay special attention to the artwork for repeating tiles, pattern should look good when repeated.
- Add a life counter and level timer. Mario will die if the timer reaches zero before he finds the level exit.

### Stretch Goals:
- Make all of the background art for the level.
- Make an animated sequence at the end of the level. Touching the flagpole should cause the flag to drop before Mario walks into the castle, exiting the level.
- Make some more levels. Re-make an entire world, or design your own levels.
